      <span class="cs-topper">The issue?</span>
      <h2 class="cs-title">Clutter is profitable.</h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Your attention is a valuable commodity. It provides businesses with an avenue to promote their products,
        services or ideas. Today, capturing your attention has become a numbers
        game.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Some businesses still prioritise long-term relationships with their customers by having thoughtful interactions,
        pursuing innovation and delivering high-quality products or services.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        But many won't. Especially in this industry, they've transitioned towards maximising short-term profit as their sole mission. This has come
        at the expense of quality, innovation, performance and passion.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        So they sell their customers a product or service that lacks substance, personality or value. They sell
        clutter.<br><br><br>

      <span class="cs-topper">So here we are -</span>
      <h2 class="cs-title">On a mission.</h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        As an antidote to chaos, Simply Stellar emerged.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Our philosophy is embodied in our name. We want to prove that simplicity can be a powerful way to cut through
        the clutter whilst providing value and creating stellar and meaningful experiences.

      <span class="cs-topper">What's our solution?</span>
      <h2 class="cs-title">A solid foundation.</h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Our workflow process is down to a science and we're itching to talk to somebody about it.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
       We started by speaking to business owners to get insight on their experiences working with web-developers. Their experiences allowed us to identify common pain-points which we address in our creative and development process.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        By putting our values into practice, we aim to create a better
        experience for you, your customers customers and raise the standard in your
        industry.
