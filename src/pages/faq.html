        What is web accessibility and why is it important for my website?
      </h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Web accessibility is important because it allows for people with different abilities to freely access your website. Ignoring web accessibility standards restricts the ability of potential clients with visual, auditory, motor and other impairments from accessing your website.
      </p>
      <br />

        How do you ensure that websites are accessible to people with
        disabilities?
      </h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        At the very least, we adhere to WCAG 2.0 accessibility guidelines. Throughout the design phase, we place a strong emphasis on legibility of fonts, high contrast between elements and creating a uniform layout with a distinct header hierarchy. In the development phase, we craft purposeful alt-text for images and descriptive text for links, ensure keyboard accessibility and provide clear labels and instructions for form fields.<br><br>We endeavour to stay updated on emerging accessibility standards and make all necessary updates to ensure continued compliance.
